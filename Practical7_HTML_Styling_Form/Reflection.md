### Reflection

In this exercise, I created and styled an HTML form for hostel room maintenance requests. The form included fields such as name, room number, type of issue, description, and urgency. My goal was to make the form user-friendly, functional, and visually appealing. 

Styling forms always presents unique challenges because each form element has its own default styles that need to be overridden for a consistent and modern look. The task allowed me to practice designing a clean, minimalistic form while focusing on user experience.

### Documentation

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - The form contained input fields like text fields (for name and room number), a dropdown menu (for type of issue), a textarea (for detailed descriptions), and a radio button group (for urgency level). 
   - Each input field was assigned a `label` to ensure clarity and accessibility.
   - Placeholders were added to guide the user, especially for more open-ended fields like description and issue type.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - **Form Layout**: I used `flexbox` to structure the form, ensuring that fields were aligned neatly and responsive across different screen sizes. This approach helped avoid the form feeling cluttered or overwhelming.
   - **Color Scheme**: I applied a soft, neutral color scheme to make the form visually easy on the eyes. Light background colors for input fields with darker text ensured readability, while accent colors for the button and focus states added visual interest.
   - **Form Inputs**: I styled the form inputs uniformly, giving them rounded corners, subtle borders, and padding to ensure they were easy to interact with. I added `:focus` styles to highlight the input fields when the user interacts with them, improving the overall usability.
   - **Submit Button**: The submit button was designed to stand out. I made it larger than the other form elements and gave it a contrasting color to draw attention. Additionally, I added hover and active states to provide feedback when the user interacts with the button.
   - **Accessibility**: I made sure to use proper label-input associations for better accessibility, which also improves usability for screen readers.

### Challenges I Faced

One challenge was achieving consistency in the appearance of different types of form elements (text inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.). Since each element has default styling that can vary between browsers, I had to apply custom styles to ensure a cohesive look. For example, dropdowns and radio buttons required extra effort to match the styles of the text inputs.

Another challenge was creating a clear visual hierarchy without overwhelming the user. While the submit button needed to stand out, the rest of the form needed to maintain a minimalist and cohesive look. I used contrasting colors and larger button sizes while keeping the overall color palette soft.

Lastly, ensuring the form was responsive across different devices required careful consideration of spacing and layout. Using `flexbox` helped with the form's structure, but I still had to tweak the spacing between elements to prevent crowding on smaller screens. Additionally, managing the focus states across all input types required testing to ensure the styling didnâ€™t break the user experience across various browsers.
