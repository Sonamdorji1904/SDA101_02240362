# Reflection
In this project, I focused on replicating a website design in Figma using basic tools and features like prototyping, hover states, dropdown menus, and a simple color scheme. My goal was to create a functional prototype that connects different pages and interactions, allowing users to click through and experience a basic website flow.

## Documentation
Throughout the design process, I maintained simplicity, using layers, groups, and frames to structure the design. I ensured that each page and element, like the dropdown menu, was clearly labeled for better organization. While the documentation was straightforward, I could have added more detailed notes, especially for the dropdown functionality, to explain how it was designed to work and why specific design decisions were made. This would have been helpful if I were sharing the project with others or needed to revisit it later.

## Reflection on the Design
Designing with Figma gave me the opportunity to explore fundamental UI elements such as dropdown menus. I created a dropdown interaction for one of the menu items, which added complexity to the design. Even though it was a basic dropdown, it improved the functionality and provided a more realistic user experience.

I also worked with hover states and a minimal color palette, ensuring that the colors were consistent across all pages. The hover effects and dropdown menu contributed to making the design feel interactive, even in a static prototype.

Prototyping in Figma was intuitive, especially when linking different pages and setting up dropdown menus. The ability to create triggers for dropdowns allowed me to simulate how users would interact with the navigation menu. While the dropdown was simple, it gave the design an added layer of depth.

## Challenges I Faced
One challenge I faced was managing the dropdown menu's functionality within Figma’s prototyping features. Since Figma isn’t primarily a development tool, creating a functional dropdown involved some creativity. I duplicated frames and added interactions to simulate the opening and closing of the dropdown, but I felt limited by the basic prototyping tools. In the future, I want to explore more advanced interaction techniques or plugins that can enhance this aspect.

Another challenge was maintaining the alignment and spacing of elements, especially when dealing with the dropdown and hover effects. Since I aimed to replicate an existing website, I needed to ensure everything matched accurately, which required extra time adjusting the design for consistency.
