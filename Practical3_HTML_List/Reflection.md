### Reflection

This exercise involved creating an HTML page with various list structures to organize my semester courses, daily class schedule, weekly to-do list, and study goals. The goal was to utilize unordered lists for non-sequential data and ordered lists for items that required a specific order, like my class schedule and subtopics for each main topic in the study goals. 

Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of how to use HTML lists effectively to organize and present content clearly. The lists provided a simple, yet powerful, way to present different types of information, and the exercise highlighted the importance of logical structure in web design.

### Documentation

1. **Unordered Lists**: I used unordered lists (`<ul>`) to display non-sequential data, such as my courses for the semester and my weekly to-do list. This was a great way to list items that didnâ€™t require a specific order but needed to be grouped together.
   
2. **Ordered Lists**: Ordered lists (`<ol>`) were utilized to display information that had a sequential nature, like my daily class schedule and subtopics under the main topics of my study goals. This made the progression of information clearer and easier to follow.

3. **Nested Lists**: The nested list structure was applied for the study goals. Main topics were represented as unordered lists, and their subtopics were structured as ordered lists under each main topic. This helped to visually separate the broad topics from the more detailed subtopics.

### Challenges I Faced

The most significant challenge I encountered was with the nesting of lists for the study goals. Initially, getting the indentation right was tricky, and the nested structure didn't display as expected. I struggled with ensuring that the main topics were clearly distinguished from the subtopics. However, through trial and error, I learned how to properly nest unordered and ordered lists within one another, ensuring a clean hierarchy that enhanced readability.

Another minor challenge was balancing clarity and aesthetics. While lists provide great structure, overusing them or not properly spacing them can clutter the page. I had to adjust the margins and paddings to create a more visually appealing and easy-to-read design.
