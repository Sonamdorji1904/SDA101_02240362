## Documentation
In this project, the main concepts I applied include:

* `CSS Flexbox and Absolute Positioning`: I used Flexbox to structure the layout of the webpage and absolute positioning to control the exact placement of certain elements, such as the image that needed to be aligned at the bottom of the section.

* `Responsive Design`: Tailwind CSS was used to make the layout responsive. This ensured that the design adapts across different screen sizes. Tailwind’s utility classes were combined with custom CSS for detailed adjustments.

* `Margin and Padding`: I applied margin and padding adjustments to fine-tune spacing between elements and align everything correctly.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired:

* `Combination of Tailwind CSS and Custom CSS`: This project helped me learn how to efficiently use Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping while relying on custom CSS for specific fine-tuning when Tailwind’s utilities were not enough.

* `CSS Absolute Positioning and Margins`: I deepened my understanding of how position: absolute works with margin adjustments, and learned how to manipulate the position of elements using negative margins.

## Reflection
`What I learned`:

* I improved my ability to implement a design accurately from a reference. I learned how to work with Tailwind CSS effectively, integrating its utility classes with more detailed custom CSS to achieve pixel-perfect layouts.
* I also learned about the various ways to control positioning, especially when working with images and the importance of using the right tools (like absolute positioning or margins) depending on the situation.

`Challenges`: 
* One of the main challenges I encountered was aligning the image to the bottom of the section in such a way that it partially overlapped the section's border.
* I was stucked on how to use four div(s) to create four different sections one for intro, one for image section and achievements section.
* It was challenging making sure the design was responsive on different screen sizes while ensuring the image's position remained fixed relative to the bottom.
